# Multi View Vision Transformer (MVVT) for Plant Age and Leaf Count Estimation

This repository implements a Multi View Vision Transformer (MVVT) model for estimating the age (in days) and the number of leaves of a plant using multi-view image data. The model is trained using a dataset containing images of plants at different growth stages.
A single model file has been created for both tasks: plant age estimation (model[1]) and leaf count prediction (model[0]), as both are trained on the same dataset.
## Features
- Uses a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** for feature extraction and prediction.
- Supports training with configurable hyperparameters.
- Handles multiple views of a plant by concatenating latent representations.
- Computes RMSE loss for both **plant age estimation** and **leaf count prediction**.

## Important Parameters
- **Number of Plants (`n_plants`)**: Defines how many different plants are included in the dataset.
- **Maximum Days of Crop (`max_days`)**: The maximum number of days considered for plant growth.
- **Number of Multi-View Images (`n_images`)**: The number of images selected from the total 24 available multi-view images per plant.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset consists of images of multiple plants (`p1`, `p2`, ..., `pn`) captured over different days (`d1`, `d2`, ..., `dm`) and categorized into five levels (`L1`, `L2`, `L3`, `L4`, `L5`). Each plant has **24 images** per growth cycle, representing different angles with a **15-degree gap** between consecutive images.

### Naming Convention
Each image follows the format:
```
radish_pX_dY_LZ_A.jpg
```
where:
- `X` represents the plant ID (`p1, p2, ...`)
- `Y` represents the day (`d1, d2, ...`)
- `Z` represents the level (`L1, L2, L3, L4, L5`)
- `A` represents the angle (ranging from `0` to `345` degrees in 15-degree increments)

```
Each plant has images captured at different time points (`d1`, `d2`, ...), categorized into five levels (`L1` to `L5`), with a total of 24 images per level taken from different angles.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy tqdm
```

## Usage

### 1. Dataset Preparation
Modify the dataset path in `CropDataset` to point to your dataset location.

### 2. Training
Run the following command to train the ViT model:
```bash
python main.py
```
Hyperparameters such as the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate can be modified directly in `main.py`.

### 3. Model Architecture
In the code, the Multi-View Vision Transformer (MVVT) is used for two task separetly:

- **MVVT for Plant Age Estimation (model[1])
- **MVVT for Leaf Count Prediction (model[0])

Each model takes n_images views as input, processes them through attention mechanisms, and then combines the extracted features using a pooling layer. The final representation is used to predict both leaf count and plant age. Below is the model architecture:


### 4. Output Metrics
- **Leaf Count RMSE**: Measures the root mean squared error in predicting the number of leaves.
-  **Leaf Count MAE**: Measures the mean absolute error in predicting the number of leaves.
- **Age RMSE**: Measures the root mean squared error  in predicting the plant’s age.
- **Age MAE**: Measures the mean absolute error in predicting the plant’s age.

## Results
During training, the loss function minimizes the RMSE loss for both leaf count and plant age. The model prints training losses per epoch.
